      >Hello and welcome to my Web ReactJS application! My name is Keith Brown and I identify as a Fullstack Developer. I graduated from Stevenson University in December 2018 and received a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Information Systems. While studying at Univeristy I primarily focused on software design for both front end and back end applications while learning languages such as C#, .Net, Java, SQL and HTML in development environments such as Visual Studio and Eclipse. After graduating, I began working at Erickson Living as a Service Desk Analyst where I received opportunities to increas my Javascript knowledge. I became enveloped in Javascript and specifically React Javascript and how it integrates with AWS.

      >My interest in learning Javascript came when I learned of its versatility in the browser. During my learning processes I started to focus solely on web-based practical applications and their uses in every day life. I was very familiar with the GoogleMaps API from a project I used in college stumbled across Amazon Web Services. I was able to put my knowledge to use while working at Erickson Living to assist with creating a web-based live shuttle tracking system.

      Before stepping into programming I studied photography and Video Editing. As a video editor I learned a lot about working with a team and building towards a large goal. Creativity played a large role in video editing as I was constantly tasked with applying a method or idea that may have already been performed, but in a different manner that makes my project unique. I still today practice video editing and photography in my spare time as one of my hobbies!

      >I'm a car enthusiast! In my spare time I'm usually working on my most recent project, a 1993 Nissan 240sx. I have completely overhauled this car over the past few years that I spent a lot of time completely rebuilding the engine to doing a full paint job. With that said, I actually have no background in being a mechanic and I am completely self-taught. I took up an interest in cars back in 2014 and started off by doing simple things like changing my brakes and rotors or doing oil changes. I believe in being able to learn any and everything that anyone else can. This idea applies to both my knowledge in programming and being a "self-proclaimed mechanic".
